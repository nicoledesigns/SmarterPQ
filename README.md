# SmarterPQ
 
 In this assignment, my task was to implement a Smarter PQ (SPQ) ADT using both min- and max-heap. 
 The heap(s) were implemented from scratch using an array that is dynamically extendable.

The following are the methods of the SPQ ADT:
• toggle(): transforms a min- to a max-priority queue or vice versa.
• removeTop(): removes and returns the entry object (a key, value pair) with the smallest or
biggest key depending on the current state of the priority queue (either Min or Max).
• insert(k,v): insert (k,v) which is a key(k), value(v) pair to the priority queue, and returns the
corresponding entry object in the priority queue.
• top(): returns the top entry (with the minimum or the maximum key depending on whether it is a
Min- or Max-priority queue, without removing the entry.
• remove(e): Removes entry object e from the priority queue and returns the entry
• replaceKey(e, k): replace entry e’s key to k and return the old key.
• replaceValue(e, v): replace entry e’s value to v and return the old value.
• state(): returns the current state (Min or Max) of the priority queue.
• isEmpty(): returns true if the priority queue is empty.
• size(): returns the current number of entries in the priority queue

What it includes:
a) Pseudocode of the implementation of the SPQ ADT 
b) Tight Big-O time complexities of: toggle (), remove (e), replaceKey (e, k), and replaceValue (e, v) operations.
c) Well documented Java source code with at least 20 different but representative examples
demonstrating the functionality of the implemented ADT.
